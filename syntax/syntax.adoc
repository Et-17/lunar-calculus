= Lunar Calculus Syntax
:toc:

So many lambda calculus interpreters are focused on small little scripts, and
make it very hard to write large programs with it. I've always found lambda
calculus so interesting, and wanted to make some big programs and perhaps even
libraries for it. To solve this, I set out to make a lambda calculus interpreter
that can handle these programs, and has support for other useful things such as
multiple files. That is what I intend to acheive with Lunar Calculus. This
document will serve as the official specification for its syntax, to guide the 
creation of its interpreter.

NOTE: Lunar Calculus is still very new, and this document could change at any 
time, for any reason.
